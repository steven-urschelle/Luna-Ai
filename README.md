## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Clone the Repository

To clone the repository, run the following command:

bash
git clone https://github.com/LunaOpenLabs/Luna-Ai.git

### Install Requirements
To install the required packages, use:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Dataset
Luna AI requires a dataset in CSV format with two columns: text and label. An example dataset is provided in the data/ directory.

### Example Dataset Structure
Hereâ€™s an example of how the dataset should be structured:

csv
text,label
"I love this product!",1
"This is the worst experience.",0

### Usage
Training the Model

To train the model, execute the following command:

bash
python training/train.py

This command will load the dataset from data/dataset.csv and initiate the training process.

### Saving and Loading the Model
After training, save the trained model using:

bash
python save_model.py

This will save the model and its tokenizer in the luna_ai_model directory.

### Testing the Model
To test the model with sample inputs, you can use the test_model.py script. Modify the sample_text variable in the script as needed.

### Run the test script with:

bash
python test_model.py

### Example Output
The model will output the predicted class for the provided sample text.
